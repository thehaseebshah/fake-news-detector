## ðŸ•¯ About
**fake-news-detector** is a *machine learning model* that predicts if a given news article is fake or not. It uses Deep Learning techniques to do so.

<!--- Additional line of information text about what the project does. Your introduction should be around 2 or 3 sentences. Don't go overboard, people won't read it.--->

## âœ¨ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of `Python`, `Tensorflow`, `Jupyter`nd have access to data science libraries through latest `Anaconda Distribution`
* If not so, you can also run the notebooks and/or scripts on `Google Colaboratory`
* You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine. 


## ðŸ’» Running the Notebook


To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1- Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).

2- Run Jupyter Notebook/Lab

Linux and macOS -- run the following on the terminal:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Windows:

Open `Anaconda Navigator` and click Jupyter Notebook.

3- Copy the project files to the directory the notebooks are running.

4- Github has a file upload limit of 100 MBs. Therefore files for this project that are larger than this limit(if any) are uploaded to a *Google Drive* and the link is [bit.ly/projdir](www.bit.ly/projdir). If, while running the notebook, you see some errors regarding missing files, download them from this link. Afterwards, copy those file(s) to the project's *proj-dir* directory.

5- Open main.ipynb

6- If you want to view how the model was built, open model.ipynb

## ðŸ““ Using the Notebook

Follow these steps to view the demos:

* Run all cells
* Follow the instructions on the notebook

<!--- Add run commands and examples you think users will find useful. Provide an options reference for bonus points! -->
